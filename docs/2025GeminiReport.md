# 2025 Wolof Calendar App - Gemini Report

## Project Overview

This report provides an analysis of the Wolof Calendar app, a Flutter-based project. The app displays the Western and Wolof calendars, along with scripture passages in Roman and Arabic scripts, with audio playback. This report offers suggestions for improving the app's efficiency, code quality, and overall maintainability for the upcoming 2025 release.

## Code Analysis

### Performance

1.  **Data Loading:** The app loads all the data from JSON files at once upon startup. This can be inefficient, especially as the data grows.

    *   **Suggestion:** Implement lazy loading for the data. Load only the data that is needed for the current view. For example, when the user is viewing a specific month, only load the data for that month. This can be achieved by using a pagination approach or by loading data on demand as the user scrolls.

2.  **Image Loading:** The app uses large images for the month headers. These images are loaded every time the month header is displayed.

    *   **Suggestion:** Use a caching mechanism for the images. The `cached_network_image` package can be used to cache network images. For local assets, you can implement a custom caching mechanism or use a package like `flutter_cache_manager`.

3.  **FPS Monitoring:** The app includes an FPS monitoring feature that is enabled by default for new users. While this is useful for debugging, it can consume resources.

    *   **Suggestion:** Consider making the FPS monitoring an opt-in feature for developers or advanced users. It can be disabled by default in the release version of the app.

### Code Style and Structure

1.  **Code Duplication:** There is some code duplication in the `settings_screen.dart` file. The `settingPicker` widget is used multiple times with similar logic.

    *   **Suggestion:** Create a more generic `SettingSwitch` widget that can be reused for different settings. This widget can take parameters for the title, the current value, and the callback function to update the value.

2.  **Large Widgets:** The `date_screen.dart` file contains a very large `build` method. This makes the code difficult to read and maintain.

    *   **Suggestion:** Break down the `build` method into smaller, more manageable widgets. Each widget should have a single responsibility. For example, you can create separate widgets for the app bar, the date list, and the scripture panel.

3.  **Unused Code:** The `fps.dart` file is a direct copy of the `flutter_fps` package. It is better to use the package directly as a dependency.

    *   **Suggestion:** Remove the `fps.dart` file and add the `flutter_fps` package to the `pubspec.yaml` file.

### State Management

The app uses the `provider` package for state management. While this is a good choice for a simple app, there are some areas where it can be improved.

1.  **Overuse of `notifyListeners()`:** The `notifyListeners()` method is called frequently, which can lead to unnecessary rebuilds of the UI.

    *   **Suggestion:** Use `Consumer` widgets to listen to specific parts of the state. This will ensure that only the widgets that depend on the changed state are rebuilt. Also, consider using `ValueNotifier` for simple state changes that only affect a single widget.

2.  **Lack of a Clear State Management Architecture:** The state is managed by multiple providers, but there is no clear architecture for how they interact with each other.

    *   **Suggestion:** Consider using a more structured state management approach, such as BLoC (Business Logic Component) or Riverpod. These packages provide a more organized way to manage the state of the app.

### Error Handling

The app has some basic error handling, but it can be improved.

1.  **Network Errors:** The app does not handle network errors gracefully. If the app fails to load data from the JSON files, it will crash.

    *   **Suggestion:** Implement a proper error handling mechanism for network requests. Show a user-friendly error message to the user if the app fails to load data.

2.  **Audio Playback Errors:** The app does not handle errors that may occur during audio playback.

    *   **Suggestion:** Add error handling to the `just_audio` player. Listen to the `playbackEventStream` and handle any errors that may occur.

## Recommendations for 2025 Release

### Dependency Update

The following dependencies should be updated to their latest versions:

*   `provider`
*   `scrollable_positioned_list`
*   `just_audio`
*   `firebase_core`
*   `firebase_analytics`
*   `flutter_native_splash`
*   `flutter_html`
*   `flutter_lints`
*   `animated_box_decoration`
*   `package_info_plus`
*   `share_plus`
*   `path_provider`

### Code Refactoring

1.  **Refactor `date_screen.dart`:** Break down the `date_screen.dart` file into smaller, more manageable widgets.
2.  **Refactor `settings_screen.dart`:** Create a generic `SettingSwitch` widget to reduce code duplication.
3.  **Refactor `months.dart`:** Implement lazy loading for the data.

### New Features

1.  **Search Functionality:** Add a search functionality to allow users to search for specific holidays or scripture passages.
2.  **Offline Mode:** Implement an offline mode to allow users to access the calendar and scripture passages without an internet connection.
3.  **Push Notifications:** Use Firebase Cloud Messaging to send push notifications to users about upcoming holidays or events.
